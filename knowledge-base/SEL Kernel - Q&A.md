## What is SEL?	

"Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) is a key part of education that helps students develop essential life skills. It teaches them how to understand and manage emotions, build strong relationships, make responsible decisions, and show empathy. By integrating SEL into the classroom, we create supportive environments where students feel valued, engaged, and prepared to contribute to their communities.

Would you like ideas on how to bring SEL into your classroom?"

## What is an SEL kernel?	

"SEL Kernels are simple, flexible activities that help teachers bring social and emotional learning into everyday classroom routines. They are quick, low-cost strategies that build skills like emotion regulation, focus, and teamwork—without requiring extensive training or materials. Teachers and other school staff can use Kernels with students or even for their own SEL growth and well-being.

Would you like suggestions for kernels that fit your classroom needs?"

## What ages and grades are the SEL kernels designed for?	

"SEL Kernels are primarily designed for elementary school students, including grades K-6, with specific adaptations for grades 5-6​​​​. 

Would you like recommendations for a specific age group or grade level?"

## What is the evidence base of SEL kernels?	"

The EASEL Lab developed SEL Kernels by analyzing over 50 evidence-based SEL programs. Beginning in 2009, they examined effective SEL programs in early childhood, elementary, middle, and high school settings. They documented the skills they targeted and instructional methods (teaching practices) and other approaches they used. EASEL Lab developed a process for identifying common strategies and practices across these diverse programs and pulling them out as stand-alone strategies (Jones et al, 2017). Thus, Kernels represent the “essential ingredients” in more traditional, comprehensive SEL programs – but without the rigidity, cost, and heavy time commitment that can make SEL program implementation difficult. The EASEL Lab created Kernels to provide high-quality SEL content in a low-cost, targeted, and accessible format.

Multiple studies have found Kernels to be feasible and effective in low-resource environments (Bailey et al, 2022a, Bailey et al, 2022b). A randomized control trial of Brain Games (a set of Kernels focused on building executive function and social skills through play) among PreK-4th grade students in low-income schools in the US found that students using Brain Games demonstrated improved attention, prosocial behavior, executive functions, and decreased impulsivity, compared to their peers (Barnes et al, 2021). A large-scale study of Kernels in Canada found that Kernels were associated with improved executive function and self-regulation skills, prosocial behavior, student-teacher relationships, and a reduction in disciplinary events (Park et al, 2021). A recent quasi-experimental study of Kernels in high-poverty urban areas of Brazil found improvements in student prosocial behavior and emotion regulation, and reductions in conduct problems, hyperactivity, and peer problems; as well as improvements in teacher-reported self-efficacy and growth mindset (Colagrossi et al, 2024)."

## Why are SEL kernels important?

"Research shows that evidence-based Kernels of practice, or low-lift, flexible, adaptable strategies, that can be easily integrated into everyday classroom routines could add value or be more efficient than a comprehensive SEL curriculum. Here’s why:

- Kernels offer teachers choice and flexibility.
- Kernels are highly customizable.
- Kernels are free and easy to use.
- Kernels can be used across a wide variety of educational contexts, adding to their impact and value.
- Kernels help cultivate children’s social, emotional, and behavioral skills - all keys to their success."

## How do I implement a kernel game in my classroom?

"To implement a kernel game in your classroom, here are key steps to keep in mind:

*Choosing Kernels:*
Select Kernels based on your students’ specific skills and interests. Match them to classroom needs, such as Cooperation Kernels for relationship building or Cognitive Skills Kernels to enhance focus. 

Kernels are organized into three stages that are labeled Learn, Grow, Expand. Choose Kernels that match your students’ abilities and watch how they build skills over time.

*Playing Kernels in 3 Steps:*
- Introduce the Skill: Clearly explain the skill to students.
- Practice Activity: Engage students in the Kernel activity and adapt it as needed.
- Reflect: Discuss with students their experiences and help them connect the skill to other contexts.

*Keeping Track of Kernels:*
Regularly document Kernel activities in the Kernel Tracker to guide future planning.

*Repeating and Adapting Kernels:*
Use Kernels daily for consistent skill-building, repeating successful activities and creatively adapting them to maintain student engagement.

Would you like more details on any of these categories, or would you like me to suggest a kernel game?"

## How do I choose a kernel game?

"Kernels are organized into three stages that are labeled Learn, Grow and Expand. Choose Kernels that match your students’ abilities and watch how they build skills over time:

- Learn Kernels are a great place to start. These Kernels work well for younger students or those who are just starting Kernels.
- Grow Kernels build on the Learn Kernels and are more complex. These Kernels include more complex steps or more challenging concepts and activities and may be more engaging for older students or those familiar with Learn Kernels.
- Expand Kernels are the most complex Kernels in the set. These Kernels include more challenging activities such as role-play or independent practice. Choose Kernels that match your students’ abilities and watch how they build skills over time.

Can you tell me more about the students in your classroom? I'd be happy to suggest a kernel game to get started!"

## What are the steps to play a kernel game?

"Each Kernel has three steps:

- In step 1, introduce the target skill for the activity. By introducing the skill, you make the skill explicit, an essential component to building skills of all kinds.
- In step 2, complete the activity with your students to practice using the skill. You can find strategies to adapt the activity based on the age of your students in the “Ideas for Adaptation and Elaboration” section of the Kernel card. These ideas can also be used to adapt the Kernel so students can play it in many ways.
- In step 3, children reflect on the skills practiced during step 2. During the reflection questions, talk with students about how hard or easy it was to play and why, which strategies they used to play, and how they might use the skill in other parts of their lives. Through reflection, students are practicing metacognitive strategies and are learning to apply the skill in new ways. Example reflection questions are listed on each card.

Can you tell me more about the students in your classroom? I'd be happy to suggest a kernel game to get started!"

## How do I keep track of the kernel games that I play with students in the classroom?	

"After using a Kernel with your students, document what you played using the Kernels Tracker. Tracking the Kernels you play gives you helpful information you can use to plan which Kernels to use in the future.

1. Track Patterns: Keep track of patterns to help you understand which Kernels you tend to use and which Kernels your students prefer. This can help you make decisions about which Kernels to try next to continue to support students’ social and emotional skills.
2. Get Creative: Adapt the Kernels Tracker to make it work for you and your students. Use stickers, digital art tools, or other materials to make your own Kernels Tracker. 
3. Involve Students: Print the Kernels tracker on a large sheet of paper and have students color the appropriate square after you complete each Kernels activity. 
4. Set Goals: With your class, set a goal to see how many Kernels you can play, or create a friendly competition with another class to see who can play more Kernels!"

## Should I repeat kernel games?

"Kernels work best when used daily. With repetition, children understand the structure of the activities and have more opportunities to practice the targeted skills, and they can share ideas for how they would like to play in the future—continuing to grow and develop their skills in new ways over time. 

Use a variety of Kernels and reuse Kernels that align with your goals and your students’ needs and interests. You may find that some Kernels are easy to repeat frequently – these Kernels may become classroom routines. By using some Kernels routinely and interspersing new Kernels along the way, students will have many opportunities to build social and emotional skills!"

## I'd like to know an activity that fosters a sense of community in my classroom.	
"One great activity to foster a sense of community is “A Cold Wind Blows.”
It’s a movement game where students share facts about themselves and discover what they have in common.

Would you like a step-by-step guide or tips for adapting it for different age groups or classroom settings?​"

## I want to increase students' ability to focus.

"Try “Catch Sounds,” where students listen for a specific sound or syllable while you read a story and respond with a movement.

It builds auditory focus and memory through fun, active listening.

Would you like the full guide or ideas for using it with role-play or visuals?​"

## I want to increase students' ability to regulate their emotions.

"Try “Cooldown Process,” where students learn a 4-step method: pause, name the feeling, choose a calming strategy, and return to the activity.

It helps students manage big emotions in real-time and practice self-regulation.

Would you like the full guide or ideas for using it with role-play or visuals?​"

## I want students to build good relationships with each other.

"Try “Cool Kid,” where one student is celebrated each day or week with compliments from peers.

It strengthens peer connection and helps students notice each other’s strengths.

Would you like the full guide or ideas for using it with role-play or visuals?​"

## I want to increase students' ability to control themselves.

"Try “Find the Secret Agent,” a guessing game where one student leads a pattern and others must follow while a “detective” tries to spot the leader.

It strengthens self-control, observation, and focus on group dynamics.

Would you like the full guide or ideas for using it with role-play or visuals?​"

## I want to increase students' ability to memorize what's taught in class.

"Try “Catch Sounds,” where students listen for a specific sound or word while you read aloud and respond with a motion.

It builds memory, attention to detail, and recall through repeated exposure.

Would you like the full guide or ideas for using it with role-play or visuals?​"

## Are there any games I can play with my fellow teachers during our school meetings?	
"Yes! Here are three SEL kernels perfect for staff meetings:

- Biggest Fan: A playful tournament where teachers face off in rock-paper-scissors, and the ""loser"" becomes the winner's biggest cheerleader. It boosts morale and reinforces support among colleagues.

- Award to a Friend: Teachers create a quick drawing or reflection, then pair up to exchange thoughtful “awards” (e.g., most creative, most joyful). It encourages appreciation and recognition.

- Feelings Circle: Everyone takes turns sharing how they’re feeling using a prompt or emotion word. It fosters trust, reflection, and team connection.

Would you like a step-by-step guide for one of these activities?"

## "How do I introduce SEL kernels to my students for the first time?

"To introduce SEL Kernels to your students for the first time:

Start by framing them as fun, short games that help everyone get better at feelings, focus, and working together​.

Choose a simple, joyful Kernel to begin with—like Abracadabra or Feelings Bingo—to build engagement and trust​​.

Explain why you're playing: These games help us learn about ourselves and each other so we can feel good and work well together."

## What if I try a kernel and it doesn’t work—should I try it again or switch?

"If a Kernel doesn’t work the first time:

Try it again—students may need repetition to understand and enjoy it​.

Reflect and adjust—simplify, shorten, or change the pacing to match your students' needs​.

Switch if needed, but revisit later when your class is ready.

Would you like tips on how to adjust Kernels for different student needs?

## Would you like a step-by-step script for introducing your first Kernel?"
Can kernel games be used as a classroom transition tool?	"Yes! Many Kernels are perfect for transitions:

Quick, games like Categories or Abracadabra help shift attention and re-energize students​.

They create smooth movement between tasks while reinforcing SEL skills.

Use them regularly to build routine and predictability.

Would you like suggestions for transition-friendly Kernels?"

## Are there any SEL kernels that work well in multi-grade classrooms?

"Yes, many Kernels work well across ages:

Games like A Cold Wind Blows or Biggest Fan promote connection and are easily adapted for mixed abilities​.

Mindfulness Kernels like 5 Senses or Belly Breathing support regulation for all ages​.

Let older students lead or model to engage everyone.

Want ideas on how to adapt one for your specific grade mix?"

## How do I adapt the kernel games to my classroom?

"You can adapt SEL Kernels in these ways:

- Increase difficulty & complexity: Add more steps, faster pace, or new rules to challenge students.
- Group students in new ways: Use pairs, small groups, or whole-class participation to foster engagement.
- Explore different types of expression: Incorporate movement, drawing, storytelling, or role-playing.
- Connect to students’ interests & identities: Relate activities to their experiences, cultures, or favorite subjects.
- Increase choice: Let students modify rules, select roles, or decide how they participate.

Would you like an example of how to adapt a specific Kernel game?​"

## How long will it take to run a kernel game with 15 children?

"Most kernel games take 5–15 minutes to run, even with a group of 15 children.

Timing depends on the activity type and how much reflection or discussion you include.

Would you like suggestions for the quickest kernels to use during transitions or breaks?"

## How long will it take to run a kernel game with 50 children?

"When leading kernel activities with large classes (e.g., 50 students), planning ahead helps activities remain engaging and manageable:

- Space and Visibility: Choose simple activities (e.g., ""Biggest Fan"") and position yourself clearly so everyone can see.

- Small Groups: Divide students into smaller groups (e.g., four groups of 20) with designated leaders to streamline participation.

- Student Leaders: Let students lead activities or transitions to enhance engagement and reduce your workload.

Would you like a brief list of kernel games ideal for large classrooms?"

## Which SEL kernel games would be best for primary school students?

"For primary students, SEL games should support core developmental needs: understanding emotions, forming relationships, and developing attention and self-regulation. At this age, learning is most effective through play, movement, and repetition.

Here are three kernels that align well:

- Feelings Bingo: Builds emotional vocabulary through repetition and recognition—key for early emotional literacy.

- A Cold Wind Blows: Strengthens social connection and belonging through active sharing and movement.

- Abracadabra: Develops attention and working memory using playful pattern recognition.

Would you like step-by-step guides or tips for making these more playful?"

## My classroom is very large, and it's hard to keep everyone focused while we're playing a game.

"When leading kernel activities with very large classes, planning ahead helps activities remain engaging and manageable:

- Space and Visibility: Choose simple activities (e.g., 'Biggest Fan') and position yourself clearly so everyone can see.

- Small Groups: Divide students into smaller groups (e.g., four groups of 20) with designated leaders to streamline participation.

- Student Leaders: Let students lead activities or transitions to enhance engagement and reduce your workload.

Would you like a brief list of kernel games ideal for large classrooms?"

## What is the first activity I should do with my second-grade classroom in rural Mozambique?	

"In rural Mozambique, classrooms often face large class sizes, limited materials, multilingual settings (with Portuguese and local languages like Emakhuwa, Xichangana, or Sena), and resource constraints. Children may walk long distances to school, have varying early childhood experiences, and carry responsibilities at home. But there's also a strong tradition of community, oral storytelling, music, and shared play—all powerful cultural assets for SEL.

So, an ideal first kernel should:

- Tap into oral and physical traditions

- Require no materials or writing

- Help students feel seen, included, and joyful

Recommended: “Silly Stories”
It builds connection through collaborative storytelling—a familiar cultural form—and lets students co-create playful, imaginative tales aloud. It’s low-pressure, joyful, and supports both listening and expressive skills.

Would you like support adapting the story content or language to your local setting?"

## How do you adapt "Sing It Silly" to an Indian classroom?

"To adapt Sing It Silly for an Indian classroom:

Use popular local tunes: swap in Bollywood songs, nursery rhymes, or regional folk songs.

Encourage language diversity: let students sing lines in Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, or their home language.

Add fun cultural twists: use classroom items as pretend microphones or add a Bollywood-style dance move.

Would you like the full step-by-step guide for Sing It Silly?"

## Some students are not sharing as openly as others. I sense some hesitation. What should I do?

"That’s common — some students need more time or safety to open up.

- Start with low-risk sharing games like Feelings Charades or Smile!, where answers aren’t personal.

- Model vulnerability yourself and validate all contributions, even small ones.

- Allow nonverbal ways to participate (e.g., gestures, drawings, partner talk).

Would you like ideas for scaffolding quiet students into more confident sharing?"

## How are the games different for kids in grade 3 and those in grade 5?

"When planning classroom activities, it's important to understand your students' developmental stages and adjust your approach accordingly:

Grade 3 (ages 8–9): At this age, students are still developing their emotional vocabulary, learning impulse control, and acquiring basic social skills. They benefit from activities that offer clear structure, repetition, and visible modeling from you as the teacher.

Grade 5 (ages 10–11): By Grade 5, students typically demonstrate stronger abstract thinking and greater self-awareness. They’re ready for activities that encourage independence, peer leadership, and deeper reflection.

For example, with the game “Abracadabra”:

For primary school students:

If you notice students starting to lose focus during lessons, play a quick round of Abracadabra to re-energize and refocus their attention.

Start slowly with just a few movements (e.g., one hand clap, one foot stomp, one jump). As students become more familiar with the game, gradually increase the number and complexity of the movements.

Invite students to become leaders of the game. They can demonstrate their own movement sequences, increasing the complexity each time.

For students in Grades 5–6:

Make the game more challenging by adding longer or more complex movement sequences.

Encourage students to take the lead or contribute their own movement ideas to include in the game. This builds ownership, creativity, and engagement."

## Why is this a good activity to do? Shouldn't I just focus on getting through the curriculum?	"

It’s a great question — and a common one.

SEL kernels strengthen skills like attention, emotion regulation, and cooperation, which directly support academic learning.When students feel safe, focused, and connected, they learn better, retain more, and need fewer behavioral reminders.

Would you like examples of how SEL games support specific academic outcomes (e.g., reading or group work)?"

## My students enjoy having fun with me, but I need get them to be serious when doing the games. How can I create a better environment to engage?

"To help students take SEL games more seriously while keeping them engaged, try the following:

- Set a tone before starting: use a calm, focused voice and give a short purpose statement (e.g., “This game helps us build focus so we can all feel ready to learn”).

- Co-create shared expectations: ask students how they want to feel during the game and agree on a few respectful behaviors.

- Use reflection time: build in questions that guide students to notice how the game helps them or their classmates.

Would you like step-by-step scripts or strategies for setting norms before SEL games?"

## I have little time today. Please give me a short activity and help me understand which core elements I need to keep for the kernel to work.

It sounds like you have a lot to cover in class. I suggest using the 'Cool Kid' strategy and focusing on the post-discussion questions. Allow a few students to participate, then transition to your other class activities.
